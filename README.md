This project is a simple Spring Boot application that I am currently developing to learn and practice the Spring Boot framework. 

I learn the fundamentals of Spring Boot, dependency injection, and REST API development.

## ðŸ“– What It Does

- Exposes a single GET endpoint to retrieve the app version in SemVer format 
- Exposes a single POST endpoint to convert an amount between USD, EUR, and PLN 
- Persists each conversion in a PostgreSQL database

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used

- JavaÂ 21 - modern version
- Spring Boot - simplyfies application development
- Hibernate (JPA)- ORM for database operations
- PostgreSQL  - robust relational database
- Maven - buid and dependency management tool
